# I'm [Your Name] — I build the "Intelligence" in S/4HANA. 🧠

I’m a **Developer Associate at SAP** and a **Data Analytics Master’s graduate (1.9)**. I don't just write code; I architect systems that turn messy enterprise data into predictive actions. Currently, I'm bridging the gap between BTP cloud-native services and the next generation of Agentic AI.

### ⚡ What's actually on my desk right now:

* **The SAP Energy Park Dashboard (BTP):** I’m currently coding the predictive logic for SAP’s Walldorf office. I’ve built a pipeline that ingests IoT sensor data, cross-references it with weather APIs and holiday calendars, and predicts CO2 output and energy load. If Walldorf's energy bill goes down, this dashboard probably helped.
    * *Tech:* Python, BTP, IoT, Predictive Modeling.

* **Joule & Agentic Roadmaps:** I’m designing how autonomous agents interact across S.Mart and S.Factory. My goal is to move beyond "chatbots" to agents that can actually execute complex inventory digitisation (S.GTIN) on their own.

### 🎓 The Thesis: Tax Automation @ 85% Accuracy
For my Master’s at **SAP S/4HANA Automation**, I tackled the "final boss" of enterprise data: **Tax Classification**.
* **The Problem:** Manual tax product classification is slow and error-prone.
* **The Build:** A Multi-Agent RAG framework using **RoBERTa** and **BETO**.
* **The Result:** Outperformed classical ML benchmarks with a **>85% SOTA accuracy** rate. 
* **Infrastructure:** Scaled and benchmarked on **AWS (EC2/EBS)**.

### 📊 Beyond the Code
* **The 99% Stat:** As a Big Data Teaching Assistant, I mentored 80 students through distributed ML concepts. 79 of them passed (99% success rate). I value clear communication and technical mentorship.
* **The 1.9:** I’m a high-performer who values analytical rigor. I believe "Good enough" is the enemy of "SOTA."
