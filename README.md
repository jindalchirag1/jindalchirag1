# Hi there, I'm Chirag Jindal 👋 

### 🤖 Developer Associate @ SAP | Data Analytics Master (1.9) | AI Orchestrator

I bridge the gap between complex data science and production-grade enterprise software. Currently, I’m focused on building the "Intelligent Enterprise" through autonomous agents and predictive sustainability dashboards.

### 🚀 What I’m working on right now:
* **🌍 Walldorf Energy Park:** Building a BTP-native dashboard that predicts energy consumption/generation and CO2 production using weather data and IoT streams.
* **🧠 Agentic AI:** Designing the technical roadmap for autonomous agents (Joule) across SAP’s S.Mart and S.Factory ecosystems.
* **⚡ Optimization:** Applying SOTA machine learning to automate mission-critical S/4HANA business processes.

### 🎓 The "SOTA" Thesis
I recently completed my Master's Thesis in **S/4HANA Automation**, where I:
* Built a **Multi-Agent RAG framework** for tax product classification.
* Fine-tuned LLMs (RoBERTa, BETO) to achieve **>85% accuracy**.
* Benchmarked performance on **AWS (EC2/EBS)** to ensure "run-ready" scalability.
